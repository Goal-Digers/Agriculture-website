                Sinchan’. Micro irrigation is also incentivized through subsidy to ensure ‘Per drop-More crop’. The
                target
                under micro-irrigation for the year 2016-17 was 8 lakh ha. against which 8.39 lakh ha have been covered.

                States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support. Presently the approach of the
                Government of India has shifted from production centric to income centric platform in the agriculture
